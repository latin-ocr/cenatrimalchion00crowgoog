The Cena Trimalcluonri'has never yet been published‚ either with '
or without a commentary, in England or in this country.

The object 01 this pamphlet is to provide for class-room use an
expurgated edition 01 it,togetherwith such notes as may be necessary
for a correct understanding of the meaning.

The text is that ol Biicheler (third edition, Berlin, 1882), which is
recognized by all scholars as the standard. ·

The notes aim to furnish the results only 01 the studies 01 the best
critical authorities, while they also indicate where the discussion 01

. different views respecting obscure or doubtful passages and words

may be found. They have been derived chiefly from L. F riedliinder’s
edition, with a German version and cornmentary (Leipsic, 1891), and
that 01Ρ. Β11111111101111100111, 1709), which contains also the com-
ments 01 a number 01 other early editors

By permission of H. W. Hayley, Ph. D.‚ class 0187, Instructor in
Latin in Harvard University, free use hasbeen made 01 a manuscript
glossary recently prepared by him.

Besides these, Mr. Hayley's Quaestrones Petronianae in Haward
Studies, Vol. II, Cesareo: De Petronii Sermone (Rome, 1887), and
Segebade: Observationes Grammaticae et Criticae (Helle, 1880), have
been found serviceable to some extent.

April, 1895.

In this second issue os the Cena a lew changes have been made in
the text, following Friedliinder. The notes have been caretully
revised and aconsiderable number 01 additions have been made to
them. “
