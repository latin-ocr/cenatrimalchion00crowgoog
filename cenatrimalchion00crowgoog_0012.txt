More than one hundred and thirty other words occur only in Petro
nius, or are very rare. It has a large number ot archaic, unusual, and
irregular forms and Greek idioms. There are in it numerous pro
verbial sayings and idiomatic phrases, especially such as illustrate
the plebeian dialect, while it also exhibits the conversational language
used by persons of different grades ot intellectual and social culture,
of the period of the early empire.

“The characters are capitally delineated, chiefly in their own words but
with a slight tone of irony. The diction ol all the personages is always in
strict conformity with their character and circumstances, Encolpius himself
uses the speech ot educated persons in the best age oi Latin literature,
though maintaining, ol course, the freedom ol the conversational style and
employinga number ot phrases and constructions peculiar to the first century
of the Christian era. Most oi the occasional speakers use aplebeian diction,
full of primitive and proverbial expressions slang‚ solecismS, archaisms and

also Graecisms (owing to the semi-Greek character oi the scene of action).'’

Scene, on the meals, the triclinium and the table utensils, are also
obtained to a considerable extent from this work oi Petronius.

Several ot the paragraphs of Scene the Ninth are as follows :

‘⁴ ln the center oi the plateau, ornamented with tortoise-shell, stood an ass
of bronze, on either side oi which hung silver panniers, filled with white and
black olives. Near this, on two silver gridirons‚ lay delicatelydressed
sausages, beneath which Syrian plums, mixed with the seed of the pome-
granate, presented the appearance of glowing coals. At the same time
slaves carried round in golden goblets the mulsum, composed of Hymettian
honey and Falernian wines.

They were still occupied in tasting the several delicacieS, when a second
and smaller tray was brought in, and placed in a vacant spot within the first.
ln an elegant basket sat a hen, ingeniously carved out of wood‚ with out-
spread wings, as it she were brooding. Straightway entered two slaves who
began searching in the chaff which filled the basket‚ and taking out some
eggs, distributed them amongst the guests. A slave then gave to each guest
a silver cochleare, which was, however, found almost too large and heavy for
the purpose, and each proceeded to break an egg with the point ot it. One
ot the Perusians then lor the first time remarked that its shell was not natural
but made ot dough, and that a fat fig-pecker was hidden in the yolk, which
