The Perusiam, who were particularly astonished by the gifts of Vertum-
nus at suchaseason, stretched across the table, and seized the inviting ⁸
apples and grapes, but drew back in affright when, as they touched them, a
stream ot saffron discharged from the fruit besprinkled them.

c. This curiosity of Roman literature abounds in wit and humor
and amusing incidents. But it is especially remarkable vtor its 'graphic
picturing of the character and social life of a large class of wealthy
persons oi the period oi the early empirc. It exhibits in a clear and
strong light their entire lack of real culture, and ot elevated tastes,
their pretence of learning, and affectation of refinement, their love
of ostentatious display, their extravagance, coarseness and devotion
to gross pleasures. In its treatment oi the subject this description
ot Trimalchio's feast embodies the essential qualitieS, without the
formos genuine Roman satire.

“The work is wonderfully elever and artistic, rull of wit, humor, and del· ¹

icate irony, displaying wide knowledge ot the world, and great dramatic
power in making the persons introduced speak in character.‘’-Bury.

’ “The Cena stands alone in Latin literature for the dramatic skill with

which the characters are made to speak each in the tone and style which
befits his position and education. We have nowhere a more vigorous sketch
of a purse-proud millionaire than in Trimalchio, who never buys anything,
as there is nothing which is not produced on some one or other of his
estateS, many of which he has never seen.

“The chief interest for us is the specimen which this work affords of every·
day manners and conversation under the Empire. We find all the usual
features of the sermo volgaris, and what especially strikes us is, that familiar
discourse at this period reproduces the archaic language of the comic drama
far more conspicuously than even the familiar correspondenca of Cicero.'’—
T yrrell.
