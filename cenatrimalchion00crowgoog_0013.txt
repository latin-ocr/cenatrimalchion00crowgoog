was strongly seasoned with pepper. Many jokes were made, and whilst the
guests were eating the mysterious eggs, the slaves again presented the
honey-wine. When no one desired more, the band, which was at the other
end oi the hall, began to play, as a sign for the slaves'to remove the
gustatorium, which they proceeded to do,

A new repositorium was placed upon the table, containing the first course
oi the cana. A slave carried round the bread in a silver basket. 'There were
ringdoves and field-fares capons and ducks, mullets of three pounds weight‚
and turbot, and, in the centre, a fatted hare, which, by means oi artificial
wings, the structor had ingeniously changed into a Pegasus

F our slaves soon entered to the sound oi horns‚ bearing the second course,
which consisted of a huge boar, surrounded by eight sucking-pigs‚ made of
sweet paste by the experienced baker, and surprisingly like real ones. On
the tusks of the boar hung little basketS,woven oi palm-twigs and containing
Syrian and Theban dates, A scissor now approaehed the table and with an
immense kniie commenced cutting up the boar. ln the meantime, the boys
handed the dates, and gave to each guest one of the pigs as apophoreta.

The slaves next produced a fresh ferculum, which, to the astonishment of
the company, contained a vast swine, cooked exactly like the boar. ‘⁶ Ha! '’
cried Lentulus, rising from his couch, in order to inspectit more closely. “I
really believe that the cook has forgotten to disembowel the animal. Bring -
him hither directly.” The cook appeared with troubled mien‚ and confessed,
to the indignation of the whole party, that in his hurry he had torgotten to
cleanse the beast. ‘⁶ You deserve a severe chastisement,’' said Lentulus to
the slave, ⁴· and may thank my good humour ior escaping it. But, as a
punishment, you must immediately perform the neglected duty in our
presence.'' The cook seized the knife, and having carefully split open the ·
belly on both sides, gave a sudden jerk, when to the agreeable sqrprise of w
the guests, a quantity ot little sausages of all kinds tumbled out.

On a given signal, the slaves removed the dish, and brought another con-
taining peacocks, pheasants, the livers oi geese, and rare fish. At length
this course also was removed, the slaves wiped the table, and cleared away
with besoms oi palm-twigs the fragments that had fallen on the iloor, strew-
ing it at the same time with sawdust, dyed with minium and pleasant·
smelling saffron.

Whilst this was being done, the eyes oi the guests were suddenly attracted
upwards by a noise over-head; the ceiling opened, and a large silver hoop,
on which were ointment-bottles oi silver and alabaster, silver garlands with
beautifullychiselled leaves and circlets‚ and other trifles, to be shared
amongst the guests as apophoreta, descended upon the table. In the mean-
time, the dessert had been served, wherein the baker gave a specimen oi his
skill. In addition to innumerable articles oi pastry, there were artificia}
muscles, field-iares filled with dried grapes and almonds‚ and many other

things of the same kind. In the middle stood a well-modeled Vertumnus,
who held in his apron a great variety of fruits. Around lay sweet quinces,
stuck tull oi almonds‚ and having the appearance of sea-urchins.
