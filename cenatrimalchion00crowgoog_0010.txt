From this account is derived the sketch of Petronius contained in
Merivale, chapter LIII. There is also atranslation of the same in
Cruttwell's History osRomarz Literature, p. 394.

2. The Satyricon.

The original title appears to have been Satirae. In some of the
MSS. it is changed to Satiricon or Petronii Arbitri satirici liber.

.The work itself has been called by some acharacter-novel‚ by
others a comic 3ηά satiric romance. It consisted of,.at least, twenty
books of which a mass of fragments only is extant. In thesea
freedman, Encolpius, describes various adventures oi himself 3ηά
his companion, Ascyltos, during 3 journey in Southern Italy.

The time of the events is assigned by Mommsen to the reign of
Augustus, by others to the reign of Tiberius, by Friedliinder to the
latter part of the reign of Claudius or the beginning of that of Nero.

“ In its form The Satyricon is asatira Menippea (first introduced into
Roman literature by Varro), in which the metrical pieces interspersed con·
tain chiefly parodies of certain fashions of taste.'’——Teuffll.

“ Whether this strange medley (resembling in some respects the Satura
Menippea) was written as a satire on Nero or Tigellinus, oron the other
hand was merely a study in the social life of the writer's time, are questions
which have been often asked and have received various answers’ T yrrell.

“The adventures of Encolpius and his companions are made the vehicle
for exposing the false taste which prevailed upon all matters connected with
literature and the fine arts, and for holding up to ridicule and detestation
the folly‚ luxury, impurity‚ and dishonesty of all classes of the community in
the age and country in which the scene is laid.'’—Ramsay.

3. Tae Cena Trimalchionis.
'l‘hc longest of the extant fragments is the noted episode com-

monly entitled Cena Trimalchionis, which Is a detailed description of
a banquet given by a freedman named Gaius Pompeius Trimalchi0,

a vain 3ηά vulgar parvenit, representing perhaps some court favorite ,

of N ero. To this feast, among other guests, Encolpius 3ηά Ascyltos
are invited because of their connection with 3 rhetorician, Agamem-
non, whose pupils they had been.
