The scene of the banquet is laid in a Roman colony in Campania,
which is supposed by Mommsen and Friedliinder to have been Cumae.
Hayley, however, gives decisive reasons tor the view, first maintained
by Ianelli early in the present century, that the place was Puteoli.

A brief account of the Cena is contained in-Cruttwell's History os

Roman Literatrere‚ p. 396, and is as follows:

“The banquet and conversation are described with great vividness. Alter
some preliminary complimentS, the host, eager to display his learning, turns
the discourse upon philology; buthe is suddenly called away, and topics of
more general interest are introduced, the guests giving their opinions on
each in a sufficiently interesting way. The remarks os one Ganymedes on
the sufferings oi the lower classes, the insufficiency of lood, and the lack of
healthy industries, are pathetic and true. Meanwhile, Trimalchio returns
and entertains his friends with discussions on rhetoric, medicine, history,
art, etc. The scene becomes animated as the wine flows, various ludicrous
incidents ensue‚ which are greeted with extemporaneous epigrams in verse,
some rather amusing, others fiat and diffuse. The conversation thus turns
to the subject of poetry. Cicero and Syrus are compared with some ability
of illustration. Jests arefreely bandied3 ghost stories are proposed, and
two marvellous Tables related. The supernatura] is then about to be dis
cussed, when agentleman named Habinnas and his portly wife Scintilla come
in. This lady exhibits her jewels with much complaceney‚ and Trimal·
chio’s wife Fortunata, roused to competitiou, does the same. Trimalchio
has now arrived at that stage of the evening’s entertainment when moumful
views of lile begin to present themselves, He calls for the necessary docu-
ments, and forthwith proceeds to make his will. His kind provision for his
relatives and dependants, combined with his afterdinner pathos, bring out
the softer side ot the company’s leeliugs3 every one weeps, and for a time
festivities are suspended. The terrible insecurity of life under Nero is here
pointedly hinted at. The will read, Trimalchio takesabath, and soon
returns in excellent spirits, ready lo dine agarna ’

Α fuller outline ol the contents of the Cena is given in Simcox:
History of Latin literature, pp. 88-97, and a still more extended and
appreciative sketch inan article entitled Petronius Arbiter in Frasests ¹
Magazr‘na February, 1874. Tyrrell: Latin Poetry (Boston, 1895),
also devotes several pages to the Cena, and gives alree and abridged
translation of some of the table talk of the guests.

4. Some Characterr'rtr'cs os tlte Certa.

a. The Banquet of Trimalchro, taking into account its brevity, has
a very considerable philological value. This is seen in the character
oi its diction. In this edition there are thirty-three words of obscure
or doubtful origin, not found in the most recent Latin lexicons.
